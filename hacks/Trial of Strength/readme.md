### Overview

This trial is meant to test the player in the strength of their resolve, acuity, and problem solving skills. This is also an attempt to showcase the extent of what toaster's work on randomprime can do. There are lots of custom objects added, objects removed, and items in places where they would normally not be possible. There are no intentional "point of no return" fast ones pulled here. If a door gets sealed behind you, you're intended to push onward until you can return. However, I can't protect you from all dangerous actions just like the randomizer can't. Either way, save often. It should be impossible to hard-lock your seed barring an extreme effort on the player side.

Warp to start is disabled. Some very specific "randomizer standard" QoL settings are also disabled. This is intentional. You're expected to explore areas, but it's okay to turn around and head back if you're not comfortable pushing forward somewhere.

Artifact Temple behavior is vanilla. This is also intentional. There are multiple instances where accessing the remaining hints lines up with intended routing, and some of them you may not even need. The hints are all custom-made, so it's worth reading them, I promise.

Your experience if you decide to leave the inbounds confinements will be poor. Aether boxes are not your friends and they will betray you. The pathing here is very intentional, and your overall enjoyment will be better if you stay inbounds.

### Difficulty

I have attempted to adhere pretty closely to the Intermediate trick logic in Randovania. However, you will be required to think about rooms in ways you never have before, and find items in places they normally aren't on occasion. Make sure you're listening closely. There are even a couple places where custom items are used. Again, pay close attention to the sounds items make.

There are incredible use-cases for certain items that commonly get ignored in speedruns and randomizer. It will be incredibly difficult to skip them. There is also lots of custom geometry. This is often done to assist with the route and changes that have been made, or to keep the player safe where it can get unfairly dangerous.

Some amount of damage runs are required. For those not as comfortable with them, an ample amount of energy tanks have been scattered around Tallon IV to accommodate this. You're also given convenient access to save stations.

And if you're having trouble getting a lock-on in certain puzzles, hold R and buffer the control stick input to look up (pull back on the control stick) before you release L.

Enjoy :)
