# Legacy Hack (Metroid Prime Plandomizer)

### [Link](https://github.com/toasterparty/metroid-prime-plandomizer)

The fan hack project started under a different name in 2020 "Metroid Prime Plandomizer". It used an old fork of the patcher for Bash's randomizer which added the ability to randomize doors with no logic.

There are 18 layout files for you to enjoy which made creative use of the limited tools available at that time. Note that installation instructions differ from this repository's.
