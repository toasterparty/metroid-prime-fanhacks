## Overview

This mod is the vanilla experience but with one major twist: ***Every room is completely submerged in water.***

From what I can tell, this should be completable. Even further, I believe there isn't any reason you shouldn't be able to finish with a 98% completion screen with the missing item being Gravity Suit. NSJ is probably possible as well.

### Tips

Here are some takeaways from my attempt at a max% no gravity playthrough (I got bored around wavesun):

- Underwater slope jumps are extremely powerful once you learn how to do them optimally. There even exists a no-items secret world in main plaza that exploits this

- R-Dashing and damage boosting are the two best ways of getting horizontal distance. You have to hold R the whole time to lock your speed, however. E-Dashing is technically better than R-Dashing if performed well enough

- The optimal bomb jump technique seems to be an HBJ, but for the end you spam 3 bombs at the apex instead of spacing them out. If done correctly you can reach reach most places you could with a single bomb jump

- Once you have boost, wallboosting is almost always better than bomb jumping. In some cases, you can get higher with a wallboost compared to SJ

- There's a couple places where two neighboring room's aether boxes overlap (e.g. by the top door in Phendrana Shorelines). You can get air-underwater if you unload the neighboring room's water box around you
