## Overview

Removes every door from the game. The scripting for doors are still preserved, so if desired you can secretize rooms by shooting the forcefield.

It's recommended you play with Dolphin's unlocked load speed option. This can be found by right clicking the game and going into it's `properties`.

Can be combined with Icefire's "Remove Walls" mod for extra zoomies. Just be sure to run this patcher after walls are removed and the ISO is rebuilt.

## Changelog

### v1.1

- Fix the load trigger in Aether Lab Entryway so that Wave Beam is not required to load the next room

### v1.0

- Initial release
